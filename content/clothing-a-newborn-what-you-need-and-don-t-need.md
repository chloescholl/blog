**What you need for baby (The first 3 months):**

Whether you are an expecting momma, her bestie, grandma, or you've done this before but want a little advice on how to cut down on the rack of clothes you already have - it's helpful to narrow down what you definitely need and don't need for a baby. I've organized by climate. I'm from Wisconsin so "Winter" to me means occasional subzero temps, frozen roads, and more days than not that are below freezing. If you are from Southern California or Tennessee, assume you will need a little less than my midwestern winter friends. 

This list should be plenty to get you through the first 8 weeks.

* For all the babies:
  * diapers, diapers, and more diapers 
    * Expect to go through about 200 per month
    * and don't forget the wipes (about 300/ month) 
  * 2-4 x newborn double zip onesies (with feet)
  * 2-4 x 0-3MO double zip onesies (with feet)
  * a REALLY good swaddle
    * Ollie swaddle or nested bean are great options
  * 2-4 x newborn short-sleeve onesies/ bodysuits
  * 2-4 x 0-3MO short-sleeve onesies/ bodysuits
  * 2-4 pairs of pants (optional esp if you are using zip-up onesies during the day and bodysuits at night)
  * A light baby hat
    * But you're likely to get at least one from the hospital 
* Winter baby list:
  * Snowsuit (better to go big eg. 3-6MO vs too small)
  * 1-2 Hats
  * 1-2 pairs of mittens
  * 1-2 pairs of booties
  * 2-4 pairs of socks
  * BONUS: a winter cover for the car-seat is great as well
* Summer baby list: 
  * 1 Swimsuit
  * 1 newborn sized baseball cap 
    * I preferred using a baseball cap because it stays in place better than a sun-hat AND the cap piece doesn't flop down into the baby's face

Our baby girl LIVED in double zip onesies through her first few months. The reverse zip onesies also do the trick - the trick being REALLY easy diaper changes. Winter or summer it's nice to have baby skin covered to protect from sun in summer and cold in winter. Buy a lightweight onesie for summer and heavier for winter.

It's nice to have body-suits as well to wear under a swaddle at night so baby doesn't over-heat. If you dress your baby too warmly at night they won't sleep well. And a swaddle is really helpful for sleep in the early months.

**What you DON'T need:**

* Mitties: babies do scratch themselves but the scratches heal very quickly and you don't want to restrain their hands when they are learning to explore and move.
* A LOT of clothes: everyone will get you clothes for baby. You need the right clothes, and if you do laundry every other day 2-4 of each item should be plenty! **If you do laundry on more of a weekly basis expect to need 8-10 of each item above.** 
* Blankets: newborns can't have blankets in their cribs for safety reasons. They take up a lot of space and it's really adorable when Aunt Sue or your coworker Chris knits you a blanket, but don't go out of your way to buy them early on. And instead of using blankets for swaddles invest in a really great swaddle that works for your baby for the first 3-4 months. 
  * Also you will most likely get a light receiving blanket from the hospital
* Long sleeved bodysuits: They are IMPOSSIBLE to get on and off a newborn in the first month or two because of their physiological flexion (arms and legs like to tuck in). If you get the zip-up onesies you will have more room to maneuver clothes on and off. 
* Shoes: Really, your baby can't walk, so why buy shoes until they can walk? That's my opinion anyways! 
* Sleep sacks: Use a swaddle for the first 3-4 months. Swaddles are WARM so don't dress baby in a sleep sack under a swaddle or they will likely overheat, unless you keep your house fairly cool at night (less than 65-70 degrees). Plus a bodysuit with buttons makes diaper changes easier at night. 
* "Cute" clothes: Mama if you're like me, you will HATE putting these on your poor baby, and as soon as they're on you'll think "gosh babe looks so uncomfortable, I want to take that off and put them in some comfy pajamas ASAP!" 

Feel free to comment if you think I've missed anything, and of course if you want blankets, shoes, and cute outfits for pictures go all out! But for those who want the bare minimum I think this is plenty to get by on. Happy shopping!
