Whether you are an expecting momma, her bestie, grandma, or you've done this before but want a little advice on how to cut down on the rack of clothes you already have - it's helpful to narrow down what you definitely need and don't need for a baby. I've organized by climate. I'm from Wisconsin so "Winter" to me means occasional subzero temps, frozen roads, and more days than not that are below freezing. If you are from Southern California or Tennessee, assume you will need a little less than my midwestern winter friends. 

This list should be plenty to get you through the first 8 weeks. 

* For all the babies:
  * diapers, diapers, and more diapers
    * and don't forget the wipes! 
  * 2-4 x newborn double zip onesies (with feet)
  * 2-4 x 0-3MO double zip onesies (with feet)
  * a REALLY good swaddle 
    * Ollie swaddle or nested bean are great options
  * 2-4 x newborn short-sleeve onesies/ bodysuits
  * 2-4 x 0-3MO short-sleeve onesies/ bodysuits
* Winter baby list:
  * Snowsuit (better to go big eg. 3-6MO vs too small)
  * 1-2 Hats
  * 1-2 pairs of mittens 
  * 1-2 pairs of booties 
  * 2-4 pairs of socks
  * BONUS: a winter cover for the car-seat is great as well 

Our baby girl LIVED in double zip onesies through her first few months. The reverse zip onesies also do the trick - the trick being REALLY easy diaper changes. 

It's nice to have body-suits as well to wear under a swaddle at night.
