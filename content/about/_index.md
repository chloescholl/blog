Welcome to the crunchy side of life! Whether you're granola as they come or plastic-wrapped goodness my hope is that you find something that can spark a little joy in your life. My blog posts are meant to help make a busy life simpler, happier, and healthier. My passions are exercise, reading and writing, cooking, and being a loving momma and wife. I am hopeful that with this blog I can create a space to sprinkle a little bit of my passion out onto the world and watch it grow (maybe into some delicious doughnuts!). 

I hope you find something that can bring a little help, happiness, or health to your life and if I'm really lucky even all three! Thank you for visiting my page and feel free to leave comments or messages. I am looking forward to connecting to like-minded individuals who I can learn from as well.
