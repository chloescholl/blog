WHY: 

* You don't want to spend $$$ on processed packs of food
* You don't want to feed your baby processed packs of food
* You want to make feeding baby EASY and YUMMY

WHEN:

* Starting at 4-6 months you can introduce "solids" or real food to babies. Prior to this babies should be exclusively breastfed.
* When your baby starts to be interested in food
* When they start sitting up on their own
* When they start bringing hands to mouth to feed

WHAT YOU NEED: 

* Food processor or blender
* Ice cube trays with a cover and silicone"punch out" bottoms
* Fresh or frozen fruits and veggies

HOW: 

* You want to start your baby with 1 new vegetable every 3-4 days, then move on to fruits. Can start with "other" foods closer to 9 months. 

1. Chop your fresh food of choice into small pieces (or you can buy frozen and already chopped fruits/ veggies to save yourself some work.
2. Boil until it is very soft
   1. eg frozen peas only need to boil about 10-15 min, fresh carrots probably closer to 20-30 depending on how big the "chunks" are
   2. some fruits like apples need to be boiled, others like raspberries or watermelon are OK to be pureed without boiling. 
3. Puree in a blender or food processor and add breastmilk or formula for more liquid consistency. Can add baby cereal to thicken (eg if using something watery like cucumbers) - but you want initial foods to be about the consistency of a broccoli cheese soup - liquid, but mushy.  
4. Scoop into ice cube trays and freeze

* You can thaw by leaving out for an hour or two before baby eats in a dish, or in a reusable squeezable baby food packet if you're on the go. 

COMBOS: (for when baby gets older) 

Babies will probably not LOVE pureed green beans and broccoli, but once you've introduced enough foods to where you can add in fruits and are feeling good about avoiding allergens, you can make combinations where baby can get fruits and veggies. Feel free to use any of the examples below, and have fun coming up with your own! I like combos that look as appealing as they taste. I enjoy this part, and so does baby. 

* Apple, kiwi and green bean
* Peach, carrot, and mango
* Strawberry, banana, beet
* Cucumber, raspberry, (little bit of) mint
* Sweet potato, carrot, banana
* Tomato, onion, (tiny bit of) garlic
* Avocado, peas, spinach
* Pineapple, celery, cantaloupe
* Zucchini, beets, banana
* Blueberry, broccoli, blackberry
* Brussel sprouts, apple, pineapple
* Cauliflower, honeydew melon, grapes
* Squash, yellow bell pepper, orange
